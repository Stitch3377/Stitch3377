# 🐢 Hello, I’m Iv

## 🎓 CS @ Northeastern University, Class of 2028

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!
I use this space to explore ideas, build small projects, and learn by doing — from robotics control systems to machine learning experiments, and everything in between.

## 🚀 What I’m Interested In
- **Robotics & Autonomous Systems** – control, perception, and making machines move with purpose.  
- **Machine Learning & AI** – tinkering with models (vision, language, generative).  
- **Creative Tech** – art-meets-code experiments (image generation, interactive apps).  
- **Software Design** – building clean, maintainable systems that actually work.
